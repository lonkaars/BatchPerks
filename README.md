# BatchPerks

## What's this

This is a simple app that puts a custom background behind items, perks, offerings and every other icon in Dead by Daylight. There is currently only the default colors in `icons.json`, but you can create themes yourself.

## How to use

1. Download a binary from [releases](github.com/lonkaars/BatchPerks/releases)
2. Unzip 

If you want to change the default backgrounds, change the png files in /icons. If you want to modify which colors go behind which perks, change icons.json

3.  Run batchperks.exe

Backing all icons up takes some time, so be patient...


## Troubleshooting

If batchperks.exe quits immediately, it means that it couldn't find your Dead by Daylight installation folder. Try the following:

1. Open steam
2. Go to your library
3. Right click on Dead by Daylight
4. Click "properties..."
5. Go to the "local files" tab
6. Click on "browse local files..."
7. Navigate to DeadByDaylight/Content/UI
8. Drag the folder called "Icons" onto batchperks.exe
9. Profit
